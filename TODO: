TODO:

Stage 1:
- Let them grab a place pin URL from Pinterest
	- have user get a URL from the website
	- provide an input field for the user to give the URL
	- parse the URL and grab the Pin ID 
- Use JS SDK to make the Request 
- GET the Pin, and specify on the Rich Pin Info
	- ok so, here's the request to the API
	https://api.pinterest.com/oauth/?
    response_type=code&
    redirect_uri=https://mywebsite.com/connect/pinterest/&
    client_id=12345&
    scope=read_public,write_public&
    state=768uyFys

- Extract the Info into a JSON
- Use JSON to pull Kayak/Expedia Info
	- we can search using latitude/longitude (this info is in the Rich Pin)
	- for example: 
		http://terminal2.expedia.com/x/mhotels/search?city=SEATTLE&checkInDate=2016-12-01&checkOutDate=2016-12-03&room1=2&apikey=INSERT_KEY_HERE
	- 

Stage 2:
- Authenticate user
- Get their boards/pins
